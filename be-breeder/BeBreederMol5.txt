# General informations: "popgen"

On "Population genetics" Be-Breeder application uses the function "popgen"
from the SNPReady package (REF) to get information regarding the frequency
of alleles  (p and q), the minor allele frequency (MAF), Expected Heterozygosity 
(He) and Observed Heterozygosity (Ho), Genetic Diversity (GD) and Polymorphic Information 
Content (PIC).

To perform these analyzes the user must provide information from groups/families
within the population and markers matrix (0,1,2) as the example format. 
If you do not provide group information, you must enter a vector of ones.

The input in the "Family Information" tab should follow the example attached 
with genotypes in the first column and group/family (PS) in the second column. 
Use the options in the selection panel to adjust your data.
