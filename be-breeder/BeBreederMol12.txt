Be-Breeder uses raw.data function from SNPReady package (REF) from R package. 
Basically this function performs the prinicpais manipulation of data sets that 
the user needs after receiving genotyping data. The matrices generated in the 
output of the analysis can be used for entry into other software or this 
application in other tabs.

To input the data on the "Dataset", it is recommended to follow the model available
in the example. Use the options in the selection panel to adjust your data.

sample       marker allele.1 allele.2
A01   PHM4468-13        G        G
A01   PHM2770-19        G        G
A01    PHM523-21     <NA>     <NA>
A01   PZA00485-2        A        A
A01   PZA00473.5        G        G
A01   PHM5232-11        C        C
A01   PZA00084.2        C        C

Then on the "Raw data" the user can mount the array by modify the follow options:

Frequency of minor allele allowed (MAF);
Minimum acceptable value of alels lost by SNP (Call Rate);
Imputation of missing data;

The user must choose the form data entry depending on the format received in genotyping,
for this he has two options:

Table or Matrix

As a result, an array of genotypes in rows and markers in columns is generated.
User can choose the data format:

(0,1,2), (-1,0,1) or (structure)
