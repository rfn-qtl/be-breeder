There are three options for Diallel Analysis: Griffing's, Gardner and Eberhart's, and Factorial designs.

When Griffing’s methodology is chosen, Be-Breeder 2.0 intuitively points out which one of the four possible methods the dataset belongs. 
They are 1) Method 1 (full diallel): parents, F1, and reciprocals, 2) Method 2 (half diallel): parents and F1’s, 4) Method 4: F1’s. 
Then, the analysis is performed according to it. The application is also capable of this function for Gardner and Eberhart’s methodology.

Input data file:

The columns sequence must be: female parent , named as "female"; male parent, named as "male"; and one column
for each trait of interest. For all of them, the information must be given in a numeric manner, including female and male identification.
Example: in the following table, row 1 (female 1 and male 1) indicates self cross, while row 2 (female 1 and male 2) an hybrid from cross 
between female 1 and male 2.
