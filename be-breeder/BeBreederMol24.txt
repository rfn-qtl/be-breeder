# General informations "Prediction and Selection":

This Be-Breeder tab allows the user to perform genomic selection to inform the 
effects of markers (previously predicted) and the array of markers of genotypes of interest.

                                y* = uZ
                                
where "y" indicates the genetic genomic predicted value by the multiplication of predicted effects of
markers ("u") with incidence matrix markers of genotypes of interest ("Z").

The input on the "Marker effect" should follow the example attached with the name of the markers in 
the first column and markers effect in the second column. Use the options in the selection panel to 
adjust your data.

    Marker         Effect

    Affx.90487485  0.7032328783

The input in the "Marker matrix" tab should follow the example attached with
genotypes in rows and markers in columns. Use the options in the selection panel to 
adjust your data.

As a result of analysis on the "Selection" the user can observe the VGG of assessed 
genotypes rankead in descending order to make selection.
